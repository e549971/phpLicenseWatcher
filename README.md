## License

   This program is licensed under the terms of GNU Public License. You can read it at http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html#SEC1 or you can find a file LICENSE in this directory with a plain text copy of it.

## What this program does

* Shows the health of a license server or a group of them
* Check which licenses are being used and who is currently using them
* Get a listing of licenses, their expiration days and number of days to expiration
* E-mail alert of licenses that will expire within certain time period ie. within next 10 days.
* Monitors server utilization
* Provides usage charts

## Warning

   There is no warranty on this package. I wrote this scripts to help myself
   keep tabs on my FlexLM servers. I am not a FlexLM developer and base my
   scripts on using the publicly available commands such as lmstat, lmdiag so
   this may not work for you. I do most of my testing using FlexLM server
   version 8.0d under RedHat Linux.

   Please do not run these scripts on a publicly available Internet server
   because phplicensewatcher has not been audited to make sure it is secure.
   It likely isn't. You have been warned.

## Limitations

   Currently only FlexLM servers are supported but in the future a wider array of license servers may be supported.

## Requirements

* PHP enabled web server
* FlexLM lmstat/lmutil/lmdiag binaries for the OS you are running the web server on. 


## Install process

1. Clone repostiory locally using git
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mcglow2-RPI/phpLicenseWatcher.git /var/www/html/
   ```
2. Create the database
```
mysqladmin create licenses
mysql -f licenses < phplicensewatcher.sql 
```

3. Update config file "./config.php" with proper values for your setup

4. Setup cron to run scheduled tasks
```0 6 * * 1 php /var/www/html/license_alert.php >> /dev/null
0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * php /var/www/html/license_util.php >> /dev/null
15 0 * * 1  php /var/www/html/license_cache.php >> /dev/null
```
5. You should use your webservers built in capabilities to password protect your site.  We use 



### Crontab details

There are there scripts that need to be executed ie. license_util.php and license_cache.php.

* License_util.php is used to get current license usage. It should be run periodically throughout the day ie. every 10 minutes.
* License_cache.php stores the total number of available licenses on particular day. This script is necessary because you may have temporary keys that may expire on a particular day and you want to capture that. It should be run once a day preferably soon after the midnight after which license server should invalidate all the expired keys.
* license_alert.php check for expiring licenses and emails admins.  I run once a week.
